// index.html:
   I used jquery for separating the header and footer code . Using jQuery to separate header and footer code means you're using jQuery, a JavaScript library,
   to organize and manage the code for your website's header and footer separately.
1. Bootstrap CSS,jquery and JS  links are added in the head tag.
2. The navigation bar is created using the Bootstrap nav-pills class, with items aligned to the right using justify-content-end.
3. Profile dropdown links are added using anchor tags for page redirection.
4. Linear gradient background color is set for the entire page.
5. Banner section is added after the navbar.
6. Media query is implemented for responsiveness in the banner section.
7. Bootstrap cards are used to create four player cards with a linear gradient background.
8. Card images are placed at the top using the card-img-top class, and a hover effect is added.
9. Anchor tags on buttons allow redirection to other pages.
10. A footer is added and centered using the justify-content-center class.

// ms_dhoni.html , virat.html , jadeja.html , rohit.html:

1. Similar navigation bar structure as in index.html.
2. Banner image is added using an external stylesheet for styling.
3. Corrected grammar and improved the thoughtnote for clarity.
4.Images are centered using the classes d-block and mx-auto.
  The style attribute sets a fixed width of 300px for the images.
  a hover effect is applied to images, giving them a rounded border and a slight rotation.
5.The text content is organized into two columns within each row.

// about.html

1.A container div with the class container-2 wraps the entire section.
The about-content class utilizes Flexbox to arrange child elements in a row.
On smaller screens , the layout adjusts using Flexbox to column direction.
2.Inside the section, there's a div with the class about-content containing 
  two child divs one for  image and another for content (content-2).
  The media query adjusts the layout for smaller screens by changing the flex-direction to column within .about-content.
